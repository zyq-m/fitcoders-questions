## Nested Loop 👩‍💻

### Nested Loop in Java

Nested loop means a loop statement inside another loop statement. That is why nested loops are also called as “loop inside loop“.

Syntax👇

```java
for ( initialization; condition; increment ) {

   for ( initialization; condition; increment ) {

      // statement of inside loop
   }

   // statement of outer loop
}
```

> Note: _There is no rule that a loop must be nested inside its own type. In fact, there can be any type of loop nested inside any type and to any level._
