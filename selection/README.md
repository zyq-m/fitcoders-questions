### Java If ... else

Java supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:

- Less than: `a < b`
- Less than or equal to: `a <= b`
- Greater than: `a > b`
- Greater than or equal to: `a >= b`
- Equal to `a == b`
- Not Equal to: `a != b`

Use the `if` statement to specify a block of Java code to be executed if a condition is `true`.

Use the `else` statement to specify a block of code to be executed if the condition is `false`.

Syntax 👇

```java
if (condition) {
  // block of code to be executed if the condition is true
} else {
  // block of code to be executed if the condition is false
}
```
