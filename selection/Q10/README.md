### Q10. Mana Lebih Mahal

Write a program that will read three double. Then your program should compare the FIRST double with the SECOND and THIRD double. If the the next number is cheaper, output "#nextinput# is cheaper than #firstinput#". Otherwise output "#firstinput# is cheaper than #nextinput#"

**Sample input:**

```
10.20
12.10
9.35
```

**Sample output:**

```
10.20 is cheaper than 12.10
9.35 is cheaper than 10.20
```

> Notes: _Declare 3 numbers and start compare. The most important thing is do not share your codes with other friends_
