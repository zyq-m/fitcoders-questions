### Balik Raya Survey

Write a program to count how many "yes" and "no" answer from a "balik-raya-awal" survey.

The first input is the total number of participants (declare as `totalparticipant`).

Then in a loop of `totalparticipant`, read the "yes" or "no" answers for each participant. Your program should calculate how many "yes" and "no" answer.

Then your program should output the statistic as the following : -

1. If total "yes" is more than "no", then your program should output "Study, study, study. Lab test lepas raya f2f. Jangan asyik main mercun. (Total yes= <>)".

2. if total "yes" is less than "no", then your program should output "Hooray merdeka. Lab test esok. Raya boleh fokus main mercun. (Total no = <>)"

3. if total "yes" is equal with "no", then your program should output "Ntah la.".

**Sample input:**

```
4
yes
no
yes
yes
```

**Sample output:**

```
Study, study, study. Lab test lepas raya f2f. Jangan asyik main mercun. (Total yes=3)
```
